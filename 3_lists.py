#3-1. Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in a list called names. Print each person’s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.

friends = ['Kate', 'Alex', 'Victoria']
print(friends[0].title())
print(friends[1].title())
print(friends[2].title())


#3-2: Greetings
#Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

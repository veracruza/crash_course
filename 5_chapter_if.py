#5-3. Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game.
#Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
#Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green.
# If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
#Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails.
# (The version that fails will have no output.)

alien_color = 'green'

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("You just earned 5 points!")

alien_color = 'red'

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("You just earned 5 points!")

#5-4. Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 5-3, and write an if-else chain.
#If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.
#If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.

alien_color = 'green'

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("You just earned 5 points!")
else:
    print("You just earned 10 points!")

#Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.
alien_color = 'yellow'

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("You just earned 5 points!")
else:
    print("You just earned 10 points!")

#5-5. Alien Colors #3: Turn your if-else chain from Exercise 5-4 into an if-elif- else chain.
#If the alien is green, print a message that the player earned 5 points.
#If the alien is yellow, print a message that the player earned 10 points.
#If the alien is red, print a message that the player earned 15 points.
#Write three versions of this program, making sure each message is printed for the appropriate color alien.

alien_color = 'red'

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("You just earned 5 points!")
elif alien_color == 'yellow':
    print("You just earned 10 points!")
else:
    print("You just earned 15 points!")
